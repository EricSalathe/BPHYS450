To mimic such a system, let us play a thought money-swap game among N people in the room. Everyone starts with 10 gold coins. The rules are: In each turn, we randomly select a person, Amy, to give a coin to another randomly-selected person, Bob. If Amy has coins in her possession, she gives one to Bob. If Amy has no coins, pick a different donor. Repeat the turns many times. What is the wealth distribution (number of coins each person has) in the end?\n",
