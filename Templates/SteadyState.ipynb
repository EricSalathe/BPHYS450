    "The solution to the Heat Equation used a difference equation to generate a sequence of solutions stepping forward in time, $T_{k+1}=MT_k$. We expect a steady-state solution $$T_{\\infty}=\\lim_{k\\longrightarrow\\infty}T_k where T_{\\infty}=MT_{\\infty}.$$\n",

    "A car rental company has three locations, P Q R. A car rented from one location can be returned to any other location. In the past, each week, p cars are rented from location P, and a fraction are returned to each location. We can make this list showing how cars rented each week are redistributed:\n",

Use [numpy.linalg.eig](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.eig.html) to find $x_{\\infty}$.
