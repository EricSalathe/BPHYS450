    "To illustrate, consider a falling object with air resistance. It has two forces acting on it, gravity and drag. Gravity is just $F_g=-mg$. Let's assume drag is opposite the direction of velocity and proportional to $v^2$ with drag coeeficient $c$, so the drag force is $F_d=-cv^2$ for $v>0$ or $F_d=cv^2$ for $v<0$. \n",
